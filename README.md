Create an asynchronous expectation in Swift Testing

## Testing with asynchronous expectations

The [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/testing-asynchronous-code) framework vends a [confirmation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/confirmation(_:expectedcount:isolation:sourcelocation:_:)) method which enables testing asynchronous code. However unlike [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/asynchronous_tests_and_expectations)’s [XCTestExpectation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestexpectation), this `confirmation` must be confirmed before the confirmation’s `body` completes. Swift Testing has no out-of-the-box way to ensure that an expectation is fulfilled at some indeterminate point in the future.

The `Expectation` vended from this library fills that gap:

```swift
@Test func testMethodEventuallyTriggersClosure() async {
    let expectation = Expectation()

    systemUnderTest.closure = { expectation.fulfill() }
    systemUnderTest.method()

    await expectation.fulfillment(within: .seconds(5))
}
```
